# Introduction

This repository depicts my own created secret language.

## General ideas

It is based on the concept of using the universe as background entropy / information store

## Concepts

- Upside down
- Reverse
- Use opposites
- Palindromes
- Embed subsentences into sentences
- Reinterpret one language as another language
- Use set theory as text
- Big letters are a textual protocol
- Small letters are a binary protocol
- Literate programming but in reverse = text is code, code is text
