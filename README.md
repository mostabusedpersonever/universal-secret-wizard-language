# Introduction

This repository depicts my own created secret language.

## General ideas

It is based on the concept of using the universe as background entropy / information store

## Concepts

- Upside down
- Reverse
- Use opposites
- Palindromes
- Embed subsentences into sentences
- Reinterpret one language as another language
- Use set theory as text
- Big letters are a textual protocol
- Small letters are a binary protocol
- Literate programming but in reverse = text is code, code is text
- math: topology, category theory, set theory, teichm√ºller theory, model theory, graph theory, algebra, projective geometry, non euclidian geometries in general
- aggregation, composition, not just opposites, just switch out terms
- all combined becomes a whole to be solved
- proofs
- linear spaces, linear algebra
- music of course, 4tel takt is 30 minutes or so
- typography is important
- past is present present is past
- negative space, white space, proximity
- art
- information theory

## Numbers
